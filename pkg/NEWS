Changes in Version 0.1-4

  o major update, Formula now supports multi-parts and multi-responses
  formula. For backward compatibility, the part and response arguments
  may take their previous values ("first", "second" or "both" for part
  and a logical value for response), although, a numerical vector is much
  more relevant by now because there may be more than two parts and
  more than one response.

  o Formula object is now a formula with 3 attributes (rhs, lhs and
  extra)


Changes in Version 0.1-3

  o added CITATION file.

  o added a has.intercept function with methods for formula and
    Formula object.

  o change the default value for model.frame.Formula: "both" for a
    two-part formula and "first" otherwise.


Changes in Version 0.1-2

  o Bug fix: as.Formula() failed for very long formulas.
  

Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o First CRAN release of package "Formula" for extended
    formula processing. This package is still under development
    and the interface might change in future versions.
  
  o Currently, this enables processing of formulas such as
      y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3
    with two parts on the right hand side.
    
  o Generalization to further formulas are planned (i.e.,
    not implemented yet), e.g.,
      y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2 + x3
      y ~ x1 + x2 | u1 | v1 + v2 + v3 | ...
    i.e., multiple responses and multi-part formulas.
